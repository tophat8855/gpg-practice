# Trying out getting the GPG key to be verified.

ok. got the SSH set up to push. this commit will be pushed from magit

going to try committing after gpg-ing? does it work?

it did not work. starting over with a new .authinfo that doesn't include personal access key

this time removed ^forge from .authinfo

ok, this time I remembered to put the public key in github

ok, trying with setting git config commig gpgsign and user.signingkey?
